# tupelo-client

Build status: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/quorumcontrol/tupelo.clj.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/quorumcontrol/tupelo.clj)

A Clojure library for using the Tupelo distributed ledger system.

Specifically it allows you to manage Tupelo chain trees and submit chain tree
transactions to a notary group for verification. It does this by communicating
with a Tupelo RPC server.

## Usage

Set as a dependency in your project:

Latest release: 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT

tools-deps:

```
com.quorumcontrol/tupelo-client {:mvn/version "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"}
```

Leiningen:

```
[com.quorumcontrol/tupelo-client "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Tests

There are some RPC integration tests that can be run against a live Tupelo RPC
server by running `lein integration-test`. Note that you will need a working
Docker environment setup and leiningen installed.
